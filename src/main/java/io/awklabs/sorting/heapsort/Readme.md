1. Construct a Complete Binary tree <br>
    1. Nodes are filled left to right
    2. Represented in a array
        1. left child node for a parent at i in the array is (2 * i) + 1
        2. right child node for a parent at i in the array is (2 * i) + 2
    3. For each node, Construct a Max Heap (Largest element should be the parent)
        1. Do this recursively.
    4. Swap the first element and the last element and repeat the process for the 0 to n-1.
