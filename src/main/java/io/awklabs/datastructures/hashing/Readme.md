Hashing

Hash Function : Function that converts a object into a hash

Hash Table : Table that stores the pointers to the actual object.

Collision Avoidance :
1. Chaining - Linked List for the elements with the same Has
2. Open Addressing 
    1. Linear Probing : Same hash elements are stored in the next available slot.
    2. Quadratic probing : Check the i^2 slot if i is full.
    3. Double Hashing : Apply another hashing function in case i is full.
