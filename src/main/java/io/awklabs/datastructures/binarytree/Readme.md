Binary Tree

Each node can be linked to 2 other nodes.

1. Given level starts at 1, The Maximum number of node at a level is ( 2 ^ (i -1))
2. Given single node tree has a height 1, The maximum number of nodes in a tree with height 'h' is 2^h - 1.

Types of Binary Trees
1. Full Binary Tree : Every node has 0 or 2 nodes. All the nodes except leaves have 2 child nodes.
2. Complete Binary Tree : All the levels are full except for the last level and the nodes are getting filled from left to right.
3. Perfect Binary Tree : All the nodes are full with 2 nodes, and all the leaves are at the same level.
4. Balanced Binary Tress : A binary tree is balanced if the height of the left sub tree and right sub tree only differ by 1.
